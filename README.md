### Hey there 🤙🏽

I'm a curious person and passionate about the universe of technology. 

Always trying to learn something new, everyday, extremely organized, seeking to be out of my comfort zone most of the  time, and also adept at "lifelong learning" concept.

Currently graduating in Computer Engineering at IFSP, where I was able to obtain repertoire and knowledge in several tools and concepts in the area, and that I seek to delve into in which I have greater affinity, such as: Networks, Data Science, AI, Economics, Entrepreneurship and Software Development.

I'm constantly learning through courses, books, podcasts, mentoring and research, mainly related to: programming, personal development and neuroscience.

Some programming languages with which I had contact:

- Python (Machine Learning and Compilers) 🧠
- C (introduction to algorithms, logic and some use on microcontrollers) 🎛
- C# (basic, using .NET) 🖥
- Java (IDEs: IntelliJ, Eclipse, and mainly AndroidStudio) 💻
- Kotlin (basic/intermediate - AndroidStudio) 📱
- SQL (familiar with the syntax, main use: queries on SQL Server, know a little about procedures, triggers and views) 🏦
